Title: A Patch for R's Operators to Support ALTREP objects
Version: 0.99.7
Date: 2019-09-11
Author: Jiefei Wang
Maintainer: Jiefei Wang <szwjf08@gmail.com>
Description: The package provides a quick fix for ALTREP. 
    An ALTREP object is an R object that behaves like an R atomic vector (e.g. integer vector). 
    The definition of an ALTREP object can be provided by users and it is possible that an 
    ALTREP object does not define a data pointer function (Or does not have a pointer). 
    In this case, most R functions will throw an error when operate on the ALTREP objects.
    This package defines S3 and S4 classes to overload common
    R functions to support these operations.
